A clone of the Internet-famous 5-letter word guessing game, for Palm OS 2.0 and later!

Binaries available in the [Releases][2] page. Do not mirror them elsewhere without [my express permission][3].

Dear PalmDB: Transphobia isn't cool.

## Compiling

To develop this application, the version 2 of the dev-package available in [this link][1] was used.
